# Road-Accident-Data-Excel-Project-
Road Accident Data Excel Project 
📊 Overview
This project focuses on analyzing road accident data to extract meaningful insights, identify key performance indicators (KPIs), and visualize trends that influence road safety. The project covers the complete data analysis workflow, from data cleaning to dashboard creation using Microsoft Excel.

🚀 Project Highlights
Data Cleaning: Processed raw data to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and standardize the dataset.
Data Processing: Added calculated columns for more insightful analysis, such as accident severity and time of occurrence.
Data Analysis: Analyzed key performance metrics, including accident frequency by road type, surface conditions, lighting in rural areas, and monthly trends using Pivot Tables and Excel functions.
Visualization: Developed visualizations to showcase insights and trends effectively.
Dashboard Creation: Created an interactive dashboard to present the findings clearly and concisely to stakeholders.
